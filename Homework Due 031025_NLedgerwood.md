What is the CLI and how to work with it.
- the way a developer navigates through a computer's file structure.  In a CLI (A.K.A. "Console", "Command Line", "Terminal", or "Shell"), the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. The computer will often display the results of the operation to the console / screen.

Understand the differences between Git and GitHub?
- Git is the command-line tool Source Control Management program that tracks file changes for you. GitHub is the online repository.

Understand the difference between the main branch and other branches of a repository.
- Your Master [main] Branch can be thought of as your primary working area.  You can create / cut a branch from this main working area that exactly copies the main branch, allowing you to make changes to the code base without endangering your original code in the master branch.

Understand what an IDE is.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.

How to open and use VS Code.
1. Open your terminal and move to your SavvyCoders directory
2. Type code . in the CLI and press 'Enter'
3. NOTE: code . launches VS Code (code) from the present directory (.)
4. Once VS Code has been opened, you might be prompted to install updates, go ahead and install these updates.

The 5 people pictured above [my parents, children, and grandmother] are my inspiration for taking this course.  In previously held positions I sacrificed a great deal of time with them due to work demands.  One role I held for over 10 years required traveling up to 75% of the time.  Anticpate sparking of this new career in a remote capacity will allow for a healthier work/life balance.
