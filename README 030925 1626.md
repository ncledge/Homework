The 5 people pictured above [my parents, children, and grandmother] are my inspiration for taking this course.  Unfortunately in previously held positions I sacrificed a great deal of time with them due to work demands.  One role I held for over 10 years required traveling up to 75% of the time.  Anticpate this start of my new career to allow for a more satisfactory and healthy work/life balance.
