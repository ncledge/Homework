# Week 1 Homework and Goals

<br >

## 1. Goal: Mastery of these Knowledge Skills

What is the CLI and how to work with it.
- the way a developer navigates through a computer's file structure.

What is a versioning control system and why we need it.
- software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Understand the differences between Git and GitHub?
- Git is the command-line tool Source Control Management program that tracks file changes for you. GitHub is the online repository.

Understand the difference between the main branch and other branches of a repository.
- Your Master [main] Branch can be thought of as your primary working area.  You can create / cut a branch from this main working area that exactly copies the main branch, allowing you to make changes to the code base without endangering your original code in the master branch.

Understand what an IDE is.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.

How to open and use VS Code.
1. Open your terminal and move to your SavvyCoders directory
2. Type code . in the CLI and press 'Enter'
3. NOTE: code . launches VS Code (code) from the present directory (.)
4. Once VS Code has been opened, you might be prompted to install updates, go ahead and install these updates.

2. Goal: Capstone Checklist Points

The homework for Week 1 will focus strictly on Capstone planning.

Please refer to the Syllabus for Capstone requirements.

If you have not done so, create an account for yourself on www.github.com (name should be professional)

Create your activities, homework, and capstone repos on GitHub, and clone them down to your local environment inside your /code/savvycoders/ folder.

Inside your Capstone repo you might want to create a documents folder for all your project documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs. (It could be useful to create a separate images folder to collect images for your project.)



Steps for Submitting the Week 1 Homework:
Complete the Week 1 Homework

Run the git commands as discussed in class, using git status before and after each command to make sure your files are correctly prepared to be pushed to GitHub!

The commands are:

git status

Note: Unstaged Files are red and files that are staged are green.

git add .

git status

Note: Your files should be stage and show up green now!

git commit -m  "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"

git push

Note: Remember what we talked about in regards to trying to push a branch that has not been created remotely. It may return as an ERROR!!! Read the message it returns as it tells you what command to run most of the time to resolve the no upstream branch error.

Go to your Homework repository on GitHub

Copy the URL of that page this should look something like:

https://github.com/yourUserName/Homework


Markdown Language Homework:
Watch this video to learn more about Markdown: Markdown Crash Course

Git & GitHub Homework:
Create 3 repos online -- Homework, Activities, Capstone
Clone these 3 repos down to you local machine inside of your savvycoders folder

In your homework repo online on GitHub, click the Green Button that says Add a README

Delete all of the text currently populating the page
In the README file write your name in a large font
Write some sub-heading about yourself in a smaller font
Create a list that explains your goals for this Data Analytics course
Add and name a web link in your readme file, for any Python coding article you found interesting
Add an image that you feel inspires you for this cohort
Write a short paragraph explaining something about your image
When done commit the new file by clicking the green Commit new file button.

Remember to pull down these changes to your homework repo on your local machine


Use git add ., git commit -m "message", and git push to upload your homework changes to GitHub in the cloud

Jira Homework:
Create a Jira ticket with your Homework Repo URL to notify us your homework is ready for review

Here is the link to that Jira board where you should create the ticket... https://scfsteam1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SDAP/boards/94


When done with homework
When homework has been completed, do the following...

Make sure your homework file is well named
Add the homework to your Homework folder

The 5 people pictured above [my parents, children, and grandmother] are my inspiration for taking this course.  Unfortunately in previously held positions I sacrificed a great deal of time with them due to work demands.  One role I held for over 10 years required traveling up to 75% of the time.  Anticpate this start of my new career to allow for a more satisfactory and healthy work/life balance.
